## Summary

This is simple expense tracker web application built in Vanilla Javascript, using HTML and CSS Flexbox Styling. This was a really cool & fun project, I learned more about HTML Tables, Rows which included creating functions for different kinds of input (text, dropdown, dates, amounts $), as well as Dynamically Adding or Removing Table Rows in Vanilla JavaScript.
This expense tracker app lets the user record expenses similar to a checkbook register.
Each expense has separate columns for different categories for recording your transaction, (by type i.e. cash, date, amount $ & including a description).
